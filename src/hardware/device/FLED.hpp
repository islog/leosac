/**
* A Facade to a LED object.
*
* This object require a valid GPIO object to work. It abstract a LED, and add a simple command on top of GPIO.
* It requires a module that implements the behavior to work properly. However, unlike GPIO modules, we are unlikely
* to have multiple implementation of a LED module.
*
* ### Configuration Requirement
* When defining a LED device in a configuration file, 2 optional configuration parameters shall be available.
*     1. `default_blink_duration` which defines how long a LED will blink if no blink duration is specified.
*     2. `default_blink_speed` which defines how fast a led will blink.
*
* Both theses options are expressed in milliseconds.
*
*
* ### Find below the LED object specifications:
*
* Note that GPIO commands are also valid LED command.
*
* Commands are sent (and response received) using REQ/REP socket. Here is a message specs:
*    1. Frame 1: `COMMAND_NAME`
*    2. Frame 2: `PARAMETER_1`
*    3. Frame 3: `PARAMETER_2`
*
* See command description for more info about parameter.
* - - - - -
*
* We define 5 commands that can be send to a LED device:
*    + `STATE` to query the current state of the device.
*    + `ON` to turn the LED on.
*    + `TOGGLE` the LED: if on if goes off; if off it goes on.
*    + `OFF` to turn the LED off.
*    + `BLINK` so that the LED will blink.
*
* #### `STATE`
* Shall return the state of the LED device. It is a bit more verbose
* than the `STATE` command directed to GPIO device.
* It can return "ON" or "OFF" (in a single frame) if the device is
* simply on or off.
*
* However, if the device is blinking this shall returns a multi
* frames message:
*
*    1. "BLINKING"
*    2. BLINK_DURATION (string)
*    3. BLINK_SPEED (string)
*    4. "ON" | "OFF" (the real current state of the underlying gpio)
*
*
* #### `ON`
* This turns the LED on. It accepts an optional `duration` parameter.
* If set, this parameter express the `duration` for which the LED shall stay on.
* This `duration` is expressed in milliseconds.
*
* The implementation shall turn the LED off after this `duration` has expired.
*
* #### `OFF`
* This turns the LED low. There is no parameter.
*
* #### `TOGGLE`
* Toggle the LED, setting it to low it was set to high, and vice versa. This command
* doesn't expect any parameter either.
*
* #### `BLINK`
* This makes the LED blink, useful for controlling your christmas tree.
* The `BLINK` command accepts 2 optionals parameter: a `duration` and a `speed`. Both are expressed in milliseconds.
*
* The second frame shall contain the duration (use -1 for infinite blink) and the third frame the speed.
*
* @note This may sound stupid, but all value (even numeric one) shall be send as string. This will likely change later.
