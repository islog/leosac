/**
* A module to support LED.
*
* While LED are basically a GPIO, this module is here to provide "higher level" construct to LED device, like BLINKing.
* For simple command (`ON`, `OFF`, `TOGGLE`) it simply forwards them to the backend GPIO device that is linked with the
* led, so it does not provide very useful addition.
* However, For blinking (which requires multiple command, with varying delay) it's pretty useful.
*
* @see FLED documentation for LED devices API.
